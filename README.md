# Linbol-System-Rebirth
README

LSR is a mod for KSP.


Currently, there are few planet packs of the large scale being developed. This modpack aims to change that by introducing a new modpack that when completed will be the largest out there. However, this is obviously very very ambitious and will take place over a year or so.  All the bodies have been planned and are pending the PQS and Heightmap/Color/Normal files. All planets, stars and moons are scaled to 2.67x scale to complement JNSQ and a very small handful of bodies are actually quite similar to those in GPP in nature.

You spawn in Revan (provisional name, named after the title that i released this mod pack in), a super-kerbin (you could even say itâ€™s a super nodens due to its similar buffing in stats), with a gravity, radius and pressure ASL 38%,30% and 190% greater than JNSQ kerbin (another mod pack of the same scale). This makes atmospheric flight easier (at least for large and less draggy craft), due to the firmer grip and better handling. Orbital speeds are so high that SSTOs are infeasible (combined with increased scale), and re-entry is deadly without heat shield- all for a more complex and difficult experience as well as the usage of multi stage launchers.

Key: First digit: Star system it is orbiting. Second+third digit:planet number of planet number of the parent from the host star. Fourth and fifth digit: Moon number from the parent. Last digit: Sub-moon order from the host moon. This is only 0 or 1 and there are no such examples in the 24 flagship bodies listed ahead.

Most of the objects are pending naming (don't ask why) and we need your help to name them (over on discord).

24 Flagship Bodies:

Linbol AA - F7V main sequence star slightly larger than Kerbol. Posesses metallicity comparable to Kerbol.

Linbol AB - M3V  main sequence star a third the size of Kerbol and fairly calm for its size.

101000 - a barren and scorched planet orbiting its host stars every two weeks.

102000 - a volcanic planet smaller than the earth with rivers of flowing magma.

103000 - a kerbin-sized desert planet with its characteristic yellow-orange tint.

104000 - a kerbin-sized habitable planet with a small set of rings and oceans.

105000 - the homeworld and also a habitable super-earth with oceans.

105030 - the furthest moon of 105000 that contains a thin atmosphere and deep canyons. (pending the unoriginal name Canyon from LS1)

106000 - a barren and inhospitable mega-earth 15 times the mass of 104000.

106020 - the much more habitable but still cold moon of 106000.

The asteroid belt where future minor planets will be added.

109000 - a relatively small white water-cloud gas giant.

109030 - the tidally heated orange desert moon 20% the mass of 103000.

110000 - the largest gas giant with a large set of rings and 14 planned moons.

110060 - an dark blue ice giant moon or potential binary, the only of its kind (in this mod).

110070 - the largest moon in the system by far and possesses a toxic purple atmosphere like eve.

111000 - a pale blue gas giant a third the mass of 110000 with a smaller set of rings.

111010 - a tidally heated icy-carbonaceous moon with oceans. (This is the flagship moon of the system and is pending the name Heyu (named after the highest peak in the homeworld 105000 where it was first observed by astronomers).

112000 - a medium-sized ice giant known for its insane winds at the cloud layer.

112010 - a large ice world with a vast underground ocean over 49 kilometers deep.

114000 - a frozen ice-world with ancient lakes, cryovolcanism and 5+ kilometer spires.

115000 - a mysterious mega-earth in a distant and eccentric orbit with a dense and deadly atmosphere.

115010 - the tidally heated (but still frozen) dark moon of 115000.

Linbol BA - K5V or K4V main sequence star slightly smaller than Kerbol.

Linbol BB - DA3.5 white dwarf that used to be a star twice the mass of Kerbol just 100 million years ago.

There are many more bodies planned but these are the 24 bodies that will be in the initial release.

Currently work in progress are those in bold.

Those italicised are complete and will be released.

(The only really earth like bodies are 104000 and 105000).

Linbol system's 24 flagship bodies are unique in their own way such as posessing a thick atmosphere and so on, and must meet the mass and radius requirements given by me. (all bodies are larger than Stock Kerbin and are at least 4% the mass of JNSQ Kerbin). The increased scale and (comparatively) large size of the homeworld (which is twice the mass of JNSQ Kerbin) makes take-offs and launches slightly harder as well as orbiting (SSTOs are probably impossible).

The four gas planets (one with a gas moon) orbit in a roughly 3:5:8:12 pattern of Semi major axes, compared to OPM/RSS 1:2:4:6. This results in a much closer gas giant configuration and also a slightly unstable one over the course of billions of years. The furthest-out gas planet orbits roughly where Sarnus would be if the system was shrunked down to stock scale and the star down to stock size. That being said, the planet pack makes up for this by implementing three new bodies further out that orbit all the way out to where Eeloo would be in JNSQ (or roughly where Urlum is). All this is done to reduce ludicrous travel times and to prevent the need for the JX2 antenna or Better Time Warp.

The textures used in this modpack vary in size by body, but as a general rule of thumb:

8192 size textures are used for large solid bodies and gas giants. (>1500km radii)

4096 size textures are used for mid sized (500-1500km radii) bodies

2048 size textures are used for small sized (<500km radii) bodies

This ensures textures are finely detailed for large bodies, and the final modpack with all 119 bodies will probably end up being larger than JNSQ and comparable to the Alpharia planet pack, at 2.2 gigabytes. 

Mods recommended:

JX2 Antenna - a large expensive and heavy antenna but with extreme network capabilities recommended for Deep Space communication. Extremely useful past 109000.

Visual Mods - only if your PC can run it

Better Time Warp - Used to speed up time - some of the outer planets are a little bit far away.

Hangar Extender - In case you need to make larger rockets. Just in general

Eve optimised Engines - For 106000 and 109070.

Distant object enhancement - to see distant objects more clearly.

Not really counts as a Mod, but also change your difficulty settings to multiply DSN modifier by 4 to make up for the large system and larger scale. Also, custom lighting should be used, everything Heyu and beyond is just really really dark.

The poles are also quite distorted in some bodies, so some gas giants have a hazardous magnetic field strong at the poles to deter Kerbals from looking at the poles up close (although this effect is most pronounced on terrestrial bodies)
